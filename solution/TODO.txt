TODO

(Focus first on USA population, SIR model.)

Define beta/gamma relation to bound peak and height predictions?
(bound R0 during search!)
Use weighed average of previous seasons' rates as proxy values?

Or, refine exp (or other logistic growth) model for this purpose.

Save some time to document progress!
