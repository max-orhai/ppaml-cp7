(Focus first on USA population, SIR model.)

spaghetti plot all seasons
    ... aligned on peaks
    ... normalized scale
fit SIR curves (beta, gamma, onset, base) to each season
plot against data to hilite differences
hand-adjust or exclude the worst fits
plot all these fit curve parameter points together
calculate their joint distribution as initial population model
bayesian update model on each new week
